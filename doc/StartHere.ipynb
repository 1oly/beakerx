    "[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and [BeakerX](https://github.com/twosigma/beakerx) are based on the idea of the lab notebook, brought to life in your web browser. Each notebook is a place for recording the written ideas, data, images, spreadsheets, diagrams, equations, and especially code, that one produces in the course of research. You can analyze, visualize, and document data and science, using multiple programming languages.  BeakerX is an extension of Jupyter, including kernels for the JVM langauges, autotranslation between languages, interactive plots, tables, and more.\n",
